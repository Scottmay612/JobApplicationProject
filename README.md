# Overview

This app is a job application app. It has two pages of texts fields where the user inputs their name, phone number, address, skills, etc. 
The Program just has two pages and will iterate through them when you press the next page button.

My purpose for creating this app was to get more comfortable with using and editing text fields on Android Studio. There is a lot of syntax 
to remember so it was great practice.

# Future Work

* Figure out how to make the first two pages' variables accessible to the third page.
* Add a back button so that the user can move backward through the pages as well as forward.
* Figure out how to store the user's information in a file so that it can be accessed again later.
